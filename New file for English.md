## Authorize HackMD on GitHub
On your first time linking HackMD with GitHub, you will be asked to authorize HackMD GitHub App to access your GitHub account AND the repos you want HackMD to link to. There are two levels of authorization needed: the account and the repositories.

### 1. Account Level Authorization
HackMD GitHub App needs your authorization to see the repos you have access to, including your personal repos and those of Organizations you belong to. 

### 2. Repo Level Authorization (Installation)
Once you authorize the HackMD GitHub App to see which repos you have access to, GitHub would let you choose which repos you would authorize, or "install", the app on. Install on as many repos as you like, or come back later to authorize more repos.
